My Public Repository
====================

This repository contains a number of PHP and Javascript files for things that I use on a fairly regular basis.

### PHP

* array_copy($array_to_copy): This function performs a deep copy on an array. (function.array_copy.php)
* array_map_reduce($array, $map_function, $reduce_function, $initial): This function performs a simple map-reduce operation on an array. (funciton.array_map_reduce.php)

### Javascript

* jpSlider: This is an AngularJS directive that slides an element in or out of view based on a boolean variable in the parent scope. (/angular/directive.slider.js)
